    #why did the above print statement fail? Because we passed in an int to our stringdef\
    #method, and tried to append it to a string. Python doesn't allow this sort of implicit\
    #conversion at run time. Instead, we need to forcibly cast our int to be a string

#it's a good idea to make your method calls at the very end of your Python script, to avoid\
#mixing up local/global scoped variables and making your code more intuitive.
